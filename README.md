## Organization

* docs/ : documentation

* datasets/ : Datasets files only
    
    Usually, files are TOO LARGE to be in version control.

* scripts/ : Specific code to prep each raw dataset into standard form

    Usual recipe: cd data_folder/ && make all

* src/ : Python source code for core methods

* experiments/ : Code for launching experiments on HPC cluster resources
