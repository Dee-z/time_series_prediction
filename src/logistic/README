# How to use this Logistic Classifier
So you want to run some classifier experiments, and you've chosen the Logistic Regression? This README provides a detailed account of how to use this regression to classify your data. This document should be updated as bugs and logistical issues are overcome.
## What kind of Data do you have?
[Binary Data](#binary)
[Multiclass Data](#Multiclass-Data)

## Binary Data
Input your data in `full_pipeline.sh` into the following variables:

**The Following Paths MUST Exist**
`SOURCE_PATH`: Path to directory with github code
`TS_DATA_PATH`: This should be the file path to the data you want to predict based on. 
`TS_METADATA_PATH`: This is the file path where your label/metadata is located. The outcome (Y label) should be here. This should be located in the same folder as `TS_DATA_PATH`
`TS_DATA_DICT_PATH`: This should be the file path to a JSON file with all of the columns for `TS_DATA_PATH`
**The Following Paths Will Be Generated If It Does Not Exist Already**
`TEMP_DATA_PATH`: This is where all of the preprocessing, splitting, training and testing of the data will go.
`REPORT_DIR`: This is where the reports of the classifier will go.
### Usage
To run the full pipeline (with all the data transformation):
`sh full_pipeline.sh`
To run **JUST** the classifier (if the data is already formatted):
`sh full_pipeline.sh classifier`

### Output

Running the multiclass classifier outputs a report with a number of metrics, a confusion matrix and a ROC curve graph. Currently, 
it will provide
* Accuracy
* Balanced Accuracy
* Log Loss/Entropy
* TPR
* FPR
* PPV
* NPV
The report will be in the path specified in REPORT_DIR in the form of a HTML file.

## Multiclass Data
Input your data in `multiclass_pipeline.sh` into the following variables:

**The Following Paths MUST Exist**
`SOURCE_PATH`: Path to directory with github code
`TS_DATA_PATH`: This should be the file path to the data you want to predict based on. 
`TS_METADATA_PATH`: This is the file path where your label/metadata is located. The outcome (Y label) should be here. This should be located in the same folder as `TS_DATA_PATH`
`TS_DATA_DICT_PATH`: This should be the file path to a JSON file with all of the columns for `TS_DATA_PATH`
`TS_METADATA_DICT_PATH`: This should be the file path to a JSON file with all of the columns for `TS_METADATA_PATH`. This should be located in the same folder as `TS_DATA_DICT_PATH`

**The Following Paths Will Be Generated If It Does Not Exist Already**
`TEMP_DATA_PATH`: This is where all of the preprocessing, splitting, training and testing of the data will go.
`REPORT_DIR`: This is where the reports of the classifier will go.
### Usage
To run the full pipeline (with all the data transformation):
`sh multiclass_pipeline.sh`
To run **JUST** the classifier (if the data is already formatted):
`sh multiclass_pipeline.sh classifier`

### Output

Running the multiclass classifier outputs a report with a number of metrics as well as several confusion matrices. It will also show
the best hyper parameters based on a grid search. Currently, 
it will provide
* Accuracy
* Balanced Accuracy
* Log Loss/Entropy
* Micro Average (More useful with class imbalances)
* Macro Average (Treat all classes equally)
* For each class, it will provide:
	* TPR
	* FPR
	* PPV
	* NPV
The report will be in the path specified in REPORT_DIR in the form of a HTML file.
