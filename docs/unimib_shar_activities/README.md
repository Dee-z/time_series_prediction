# UniMiB SHAR Dataset

University of Milano Bicocca Smartphone-based Human Activity Recognition

## Supervised Time-series prediction task

Given x,y,z accelerometer observations for a short time while smartphone was in a users' pocket, predict which of 9 possible activities of daily living (run, walk, stand, sit, etc.) the user was performing.

## Dataset Description

* 9 activity categories

* 7579 sequences (each labeled with one of 9 categories)
* Each time series exactly 151 timesteps long
* * Study had a fixed window design, collected using prescribed protocol instructing users to perform certain actions (e.g. not 'in the wild')

* 30 subjects (each subject contributed many sequences to each category)
* 2 carry positions (right pocket, left pocket)
